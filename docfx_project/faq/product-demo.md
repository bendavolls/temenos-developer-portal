 ### What should I show in my MarketPlace Product Demo?

As a MarketPlace Developer, you have access to the MarketPlace Provider Sandbox to show how your product engages with T24 and begin the customer onboarding experience. The best demonstrations present no-risk novelty in a familiar setting, which can be easily converted into a sale once the customer is comfortable using your product. 

**Tell** the customer that you understand their needs. You know what problems your customers need to fix and you know how your product can help. The Features and Benefits section of your MarketPlace product page can explain what makes your product rise above the competition. Why not add a public YouTube or Vimeo video link, press articles and current customer icons to help strengthen your case?  

**Show** a vision of the future, where your product is integrated with theirs. Connect a MarketPlace Provider Sandbox linked web-frontend or downloadable plug-in, to allow a user to familiarise themselves with your product during the free trial demo. Why not speak to your sales team to see which demo use-cases result in 'aha' moments for their prospective customers?

**Do** let the customer experience the product, your way. You can customise the demo with your best use cases to ensure the right experience is delivered.  Different trial lengths are available, but a 30-day trial allows a customer to get used to using your product, increasing the odds of long-term adoption once the trial expires.

<br>

<br> 
 - Dynamic: Update-without new downloads
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Knowledge prerequisites:</b>
<br>
 - iOS/Android developing knowledge
<br>
 - Apache Cordova knowledge (the underlying framework thatâ€™s powering SmartHybrid)
<br>
 - Web developing knowledge
<br>
 - JAVA knowledge
<br>
<br>
<b>Tools and documentation:</b>
<br>
 - Latest UXP version installation
 - <br>
 - Access to UXP user guides
<br>
<b>Note:</b> The APK and Java refer to Android, but the concept applies to iOS as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>Steps to follow:</b>
<br>
<b>1.</b> Get familiar with Cordova (install it on your computer and write a Hello World project). Please check [**here**](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html) information about Cordova.
<br>
<b>2.</b> Build the APK and run it on your mobile.
<br>
<b>3.</b> Integrate your application SDK into that simple application. This way you will understand what a Cordova plugin is. During this process you will write some java files and javascript methods. You will invoke the javascript methods from static html pages (maybe index.html) from your simple application.
<br>
<b>4.</b> Take the plugin files and install it in TCMB as an additional Cordova plugin. You will need to write an UXP widget that invokes the javascript methods.
*(The user guides contain UXP related information, such as widgets and the integration of custom Cordova plugins.)*
<br>
<b>5.</b> For creating Cordova custom plugins, the information is available on the Cordova website, then the plugin directory can be included in the UXP solution (TCMB in this case) using the Project > Properties > Additional Cordova Plugins tab. We distribute a few hybrid widgets and Cordova plugins out of the box; this can give an idea on how the widget interacts with the respective plugin from the HTML page.
<br>
This is a brief summary for the steps to follow. Please refer also to Temenos UXP Hybrid Guide.

This user guide shows how to install Temenos User Experience in order to be able to use Temenos Mobile Banking application.

# Pre-requisites

 - Download JDK from following [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html "JDK") and install the application

# Installation Steps

 - Create a folder where Temenos UXP should be installed

>[!Note]
>:bulb: In order to avoid Windows problems, please use short paths.

**Example**: For the purpose of this document, a folder called E6111 is created directly on D partion.


 - **Unzip** Temenos UXP folder and **launch** UXP installation (double click on appropriate install.exe file - example: TemenosUXP6_1_1__1_x64Windows)
 - UXP installation starts (*InstallAnywhere is preparing to install...*)
 - Click next to pass through installation steps. 
 - On License Agreement, accept Terms and Agreements
 - On Install Set, you can also check 'Hybrid Master' and 'Hybrid Android Slave' if you need it (in this case, Install Set will automatically change to 'Custom')
 - On Install Folder, **do not leave default path**. Instead, **select** the folder you created before (for UXP installation)
 - Choose UXP shortcut location:
 *example: "In a new Program Group"*
- Choose a JDK version 1.8 (select the path where you previously installed Java Development Kit)


 - Set the address and the port:
  - Hybrid Master address: *localhost*
  - Hybrid Master port: *9022*
- See all information in pre-installation summary and press install button

- Wait for installation to be completed.

### Product page types

There are two main product page types available;

 1. The **Web App** will deliver a URL, via a short-cut created in the customers 'My Apps' page
 2. The **Download** product type will immediately offer a downloadable file (.zip)

The **Web App** has two variant modes; 

a. The Web App instantly delivers a user to a URL of your choice via a MyApps shortcut. This product page type allows automated distribution of your demo and therefore has the lowest associated admin overhead, although you need to make sure the front-end is ready to receive customers and that any demo use-cases are documented either on MarketPlace or your web front-end. 

b. The Web App (Manual set up) delivers the same shortcut as above, but this is only accessible following your *manual* approval.

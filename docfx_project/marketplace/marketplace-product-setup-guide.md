# Where will your product be featured?

To showcase your product or service as effectively as possible, you should visualise your MarketPlace product page as an extension of your existing product marketing.

Your product will be highly visible to our customers and prospects as it will appear on a number of public pages:

## Homepage:

![](./images/setup-welcome.png)

## The "All Applications" listing page:

![](./images/setup-applications.png)

## On its own product profile page:

# Building a Product Page

## Received your welcome email?

To start developing your own product page, you will need to have been granted Developer access by the MarketPlace Team. This is carried out within 24hrs of the contract being signed, with the named contact receiving a welcome email containing a selection of useful tools and links.


## Log into MarketPlace:

Log in to [Temenos MarketPlace](https://temenos.byappdirect.com/login?110326251) by either clicking the link in the email or with the username (email address) and password you selected when you signed up.

## Creating your first product:

**Process:**


1. Create your product on the MarketPlace 
2. Configure your product page (adding features, benefits and other sales collateral) 
3. When 100% complete, click the Publish button and send it to the MarketPlace team for review. 
4. Await the results and coordinate your go to market activities with Temenos 
5. Your product page is live on the MarketPlace

Clicking on the **+ Add Products** button will take you to the **Create New Product** screen.

## Defining your product

What type of user experience does your product or service offer?

Do you offer an individually licensed downloadable Temenos core plug-in, or public access to an on-line dashboard containing model data? Your product page can handle multiple product types.

### Product Page Types:

There are two types of product page available.

1. The Web App will point a user to a web link, via a shortcut created in the customer 'My Apps' page.
2. The Download Product Type will immediately offer a downloadable file, which a user can run when on their local machine.

The 'Web App (manual set up)' product also offers access to a web link, but access is given via a manual process you administer. We recommend using a 'Web App (manual set up)' product page if you are planning to launch with a simple product page for lead generation activities, as the 'Free Trial' functionality can be switched off at publication stage.

### Integration Type:

The Integration type effects how customers can interact with your product on the page. Temenos will not publish 'Referral Only' product pages, so we recommend selecting the Full Integration.

> [!Note]
> With a 'Web App (manual set up)' product page, selecting 'Full Integration' will create a series of Integration Tests you will need to complete to move your product page from 0 - 100% completion - we will explain these below in the Integration Test section.

### Usage Model:

More than one MarketPlace customer request a trial of your product from the same organisation, with a Single User licence the first customer will need to re-assign the licence to the next product owner (customer). We recommend selecting Multiple Users to ensure your product can have multiple consumers at the same organisation.

### Revenue Model:

MarketPlace offers a range of Revenue Models to choose from. We recommend selecting 'Free' as both our Enterprise level sales are completed offline and to keep the product page build as simple as possible.


## Adding Collateral:

### Web App/Web App (manual set up) products:


![](./images/setup-webapp.png)

There are 2 configuration component steps (see image above):

1.	Create Marketing Profile
2.	Create Editions and Pricing

To get the Product Page ready for publishing, you need to populate the various sections and sub-sections indicated in the box on the left-hand side of your product dashboard. These are split on 3 main sections:

1.	Profile & Branding
2.	Editions and Pricing
3.	Settings


> [!Note]
>  You may be wondering why Step 2 **(Create Editions and Pricing)** is complete. This is because we selected 'Free' as the Revenue Model in when creating the Product Page. This can be updated through self-service configuration at any stage.

> [!Warning]
>  Before getting started, please note after every change made to your product profile, you will need to navigate to the bottom of the page to select **Save** or **Save and Preview** to have your changes reflected.

### Profile & Branding:

The following screenshot gives you an overview of where the information you add to the Manage Listing Info page will appear on your product page and on the homepage/all applications pages so that you have a better understanding of the various sections.

You can add multiple categories to your product by clicking on the + Add another category button. We suggest you set two categories – Technology -> [your type of product] and the most appropriate other category (e.g. Digital Engagement -> User experience).

If you need a new category or sub-category created, your Channel Administrator can do so in a few simple steps:
  - Click Manage > Channel

# Highlights

Temenos’ ground breaking channels solutions enable you to deliver products and services for any business line (retail, corporate, wealth, universal) across all self-service and assisted channels (branch, contact center, RM advisors, internet, mobile) for any user (customer, teller, advisor) and accessible by any device (desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, smartTV) and in any language – with a consistent, optimized user experience, all delivered from a single platform

##  Rapid deployment

Pre-packaged channel solutions for retail, corporate and wealth are fully regionalized enabling rapid deployment, speed to market and fast time to value and compliance with local regulatory requirement.

##  Superior, consistent user experience

You will be able to provide a rich, dynamic consistent user experience to your retail, corporate or wealth customers across all channels. Solutions are responsive to design so the experience is optimized whatever device type your customers and financial advisers choose to use. The user experience you provide to your customers will be a key competitive differentiator.

##  Reduced cost of ownership

With all business line solutions across all channels managed from a single platform the IT architecture is dramatically simplified. This approach provides you with low cost of ownership with reduced maintenance costs by up to 95%. A single platform also provides you with the business agility to respond to fast moving customer demands and market requirements.


##  Componentized

The functionality of the solutions can be easily extended by deploying a wide range of available components. For example, if you are a retail bank you may wish to offer some added value functionality specifically for your HNWI (high net worth individual) customers.


##  Flexible and configurable

Solutions are highly configurable using a code free environment and corporate branding is simple to apply. Enhancements to the user interface to keep it fresh and relevant are easily done without any impact on the core business logic. Multiple brands, or a differentiated user experience for customer segments or new target markets, is easily achieved from a single business process thereby accelerating speed to market and reducing ongoing maintenance.

##  Extendable

The underlying UXP includes a powerful, flexible development platform that can be extended across the enterprise to enable the rapid development of additional online or mobile applications. Our unique SmartHybrid development approach encompasses the very best of native and web technologies. This enables the development of high performance, native ‘look and feel’, rich and dynamic mobile applications for Windows, IOS and Android devices. Your customers will only need to download the application once as enhancements and updates are automatically uploaded.

##  Full integration for Experience Driven Banking

Solutions can be further enriched with advanced and embedded analytics and front office capabilities such as PFM (personal financial management), rewards and loyalty schemes and real-time campaign marketing. This enables you to enter the realm of providing your customers with ‘Experience Driven Banking’ that is contextual, and relevant to their needs, delivering value added offers and financial advice at the right time, in the right place.

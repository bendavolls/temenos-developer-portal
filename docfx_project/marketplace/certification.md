# Product Certification
The submission of a Product is governed by the Temenos Marketplace Certification and Provider Agreement, this document is intended to assist with gaining certification for a product and does not amend or vary the terms of the Temenos Marketplace Certification and Provider Agreement.

# Submission and review process
Temenos only publishes products and solutions developed by its Temenos members onto the Temenos MarketPlace (the “Products”) which Temenos has certified in accordance with these Guidelines. The aim is to certify that the Product can be demonstrated with the Temenos core banking system ‘sandbox’ and is suitable for the publication.

# Certification tiers
During the course of your submission to the Temenos MarketPlace, you will be asked to choose a certification tier based on the Product or software service to be certified. You will need choose tier 1 - 4 in the certification and provider order form - covering subscription based software services (SaaS), Widgets, Business Apps, Fintech products or Enterprise product. 

At Temenos, we tailor the certification process to the type of Product submitted to make allowances for the functional and non-functional characteristics of each Product type. Temenos requests all Temenos MarketPlace providers to review their Product against the following guidance to help choose the correct Product type and determine any applicable Certification fees. The Temenos MarketPlace does not accept, publish or certify non-software based services.

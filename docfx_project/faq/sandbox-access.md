### How do I access my Sandbox?

We are currently building a shortcut to the sandbox on the MarketPlace, so in the next few weeks, you will be able to login to the "MyApps" page of MarketPlace and click the 'MarketPlace Provider Sandbox' icon. From here you will see your users, any default passwords, login URLs and other useful information. 


While we build this product, please continue to use the instructions found in your MarketPlace Welcome email to log in (if you no longer have this, please contact marketplace@temenos.com).

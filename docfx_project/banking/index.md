# Digital Banking Suites


>[!NOTE]
>The Temenos Suites not only empower banks to transform their customers’ experience, but overcome the long-standing barriers to investment by, for example, enabling banks to progressively renovate systems, thereby speeding up time to value and lowering risk to value.
>

The Temenos Suites provide the solution for banks to serve up the right customer insights at the right moment, via the right channel, at the same time as driving massive efficiencies in the back-office: in short, they offer front office differentiation with back office automation.


The two are highly connected. Having a user interface that is intuitive and seamless is essential. But the quality of the overall user experience requires that banks are able to draw insights in real time and from multiple datasets. Moreover, the speed of fulfilment is also critical, and so it really matters that the digital solution is front-to-back.

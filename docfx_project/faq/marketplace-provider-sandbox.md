### What is the MarketPlace Provider Sandbox?

As a MarketPlace Provider, you have access to the MarketPlace Provider Sandbox, to help build, test and demonstrate your product's T24-integration.

The MarketPlace Provider Sandbox is a live instance of T24, containing model bank data running on a secure virtual machine. This means you can connect your product to a working T24 instance to show how it works for Temenos Customers and Temenos Sales, right from your Product Page on the Temenos MarketPlace.

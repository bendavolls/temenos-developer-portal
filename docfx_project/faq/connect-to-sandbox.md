### What should I connect to the MarketPlace Provider Sandbox?

We recommend a web-frontend that allows a user to experience your product while leveraging T24 model bank data. 
- Describe your use-case(s) on the MarketPlace product page
- Connect your web-frontend to the MarketPlace Provider Sandbox
- Connect the product to the MarketPlace product page
- Run through any required integration tests so you can capture demo user data
- Publish the product page and follow-up on activated trials

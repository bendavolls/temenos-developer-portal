### How can my Product interact with the Sandbox?

Your product/service can invoke our public REST APIs, in order to create, read and/or update the records in the T24 instance. 

Some of the available API functionalities are:

•	create/retrieve payment information

•	create/retrieve fund transfer payments/SEPA payments information
